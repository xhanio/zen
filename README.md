# Zen

**Zen turns a long piece of writing into a deck of short, titled cards** — then
lets you group them, search them, and refine them with an AI agent. It is a
self-hosted knowledge tool: your notes live in a SQLite file on your own
machine, and the intelligence comes from *your* Claude Code session over MCP —
there is no LLM baked into Zen.

## The idea

A spec, a design doc, a research dump — long text is hard to navigate and hard
to reuse. Zen breaks it into **cards**:

- A **card** has a title and a body (markdown, HTML, or plain text).
- Cards live in flat **groups** and carry **tags**.
- A card can be **decomposed** into child cards along its own headings — a
  *lossless split*, so the pieces reproduce the original. The reverse,
  **compose**, joins cards back into one.
- A card that has children *is* a **document** — the multi-section unit of a
  group.
- Cards sit at an abstraction **level** within their group (principle → detail),
  and full-text **search** runs over everything via SQLite FTS5.

## AI, over MCP — not inside Zen

Zen ships no model. Instead it exposes its operations as **MCP tools**
(`card.create`, `decompose`, `compose`, `search`, `group.*`, …) that an external
agent drives. The companion **Claude Code plugin** wires this up both ways:

- you chat from Zen's web UI and the message is pushed into your Claude Code
  session as a channel event;
- Claude replies and edits your cards through the MCP tools, staying anchored to
  the card or group you were looking at.

See [`plugins/zen/README.md`](plugins/zen/README.md) for the plugin.

## Run it

Zen ships as one self-contained Docker image that carries its own installer.
With only Docker installed:

```bash
docker run --rm --entrypoint cat \
  docker.io/xhanio/zen-allinone:latest /app/install.sh > zen-install.sh
bash zen-install.sh
```

That pulls the image, starts Zen at **http://localhost:38000**, and drops the
matching `zen-channel` plugin binary on your `$PATH`. Your cards live in
`~/zen/data` — a plain folder you can back up by copying. Manage it with
`bash zen-install.sh --update` / `--uninstall`.

## Develop

Prerequisites: **Go 1.26+**, **Node 20+**, and [`gopro`](https://github.com/xhanio/gopro)
(the build tool) on your `$PATH`.

```bash
make deps      # npm install in frontend/
make dev       # zen-backend + Vite dev server together (Ctrl-C stops both)
make test      # go test ./...  +  frontend vitest
make help      # all targets
```

`make dev` serves the SPA against a local backend on a `/tmp/zen-local.db`
SQLite file; `make reset-db` wipes it to re-run migrations.

## Architecture

Three Go binaries and a web UI, over one SQLite database:

| Component | What it is | Stack |
|---|---|---|
| **zen-backend** | REST + WebSocket API, migrations, FTS5 search | Go, Echo, SQLite (cgo, `sqlite_fts5`) |
| **zen-mcp** | the `zen` HTTP MCP server (card/group/search tools) | Go, `modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` |
| **zen-channel** | the plugin's local stdio MCP server (channel push + `reply`) | Go, pure (no cgo) |
| **zen-frontend** | the single-page web UI | Vue 3, Vite, TypeScript, Pinia, Tailwind |

SQLite is deliberate: single-file, single-binary, trivial to back up. FTS5
powers search, and `-tags sqlite_fts5` is required at build time — the backend
creates FTS5 virtual tables at boot.

## Deployment

Built and packaged with [`gopro`](https://github.com/xhanio/gopro) from
[`project.yaml`](project.yaml). Two delivery modes:

- **all-in-one** (`-e allinone`) — one image (`docker.io/xhanio/zen-allinone`)
  running nginx + backend + MCP daemon under a supervising entrypoint; the
  `install.sh` above targets this. `linux/amd64`; Docker Desktop emulates it on
  Apple Silicon.
- **prod** (`-e prod`) — the same three services as separate images behind a
  compose file, for a conventional multi-container deploy.

## Layout

```
pkg/                  backend, MCP, channel, and service packages
frontend/             Vue SPA
build/                Dockerfiles + binary build sources
env/                  per-environment gopro config + compose templates
scripts/install.sh    the self-bootstrapping installer (baked into the image)
plugins/zen/          the Claude Code plugin (skills + .mcp.json)
project.yaml          gopro build/deploy configuration
```
